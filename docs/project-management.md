   - Basic CLI framework
   - Configuration management

2. **⚡ Core Features** (Phase 2)
   - Markdown parser
   - Template engine
   - Site generation pipeline

3. **✨ Additional Features** (Phase 3)
   - Syntax highlighting
   - RSS/Atom feeds
   - Enhanced functionality

4. **🔧 Quality & Automation** (Phase 4)
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Documentation
   - Testing framework

5. **🚀 Release Preparation** (Phase 5)
   - Final testing
   - Release automation
   - v1.0 launch

   - Merged to main branch

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Sprint Planning (2-week sprints)

**Sprint 1** (Week 1-2)
- Issues: #2, #3
- Goal: Basic foundation and markdown parsing

**Sprint 2** (Week 3-4)
- Issues: #4, #5
- Goal: Template engine and site generation

**Sprint 3** (Week 5-6)
- Issues: #6, #7, #8
- Goal: Additional features and CI/CD

**Sprint 4** (Week 7-8)
- Issues: #9, #10
- Goal: Documentation and release preparation

### Key Metrics

- **Velocity**: Issues completed per sprint
- **Burn-down**: Remaining story points over time
- **Cycle Time**: Time from "In Progress" to "Done"
- **Lead Time**: Time from "Backlog" to "Done"

## 🎲 Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

1. **Performance Requirements**
   - Risk: Build times exceed 5-minute target
   - Mitigation: Early performance testing, parallel processing

2. **Template Engine Complexity**
   - Risk: Custom functions become too complex
   - Mitigation: Start with simple functions, iterate

3. **CI/CD Setup**
   - Risk: Cross-platform testing issues
   - Mitigation: Start with single platform, expand gradually

### Contingency Plans

- **Scope Reduction**: Remove non-critical features if timeline at risk
- **Quality Gates**: Don't compromise on test coverage or documentation
- **External Dependencies**: Have backup libraries identified

## 📋 Meeting Schedule

### Weekly Standup (If team expands)
- **When**: Every Monday 10:00 AM JST
- **Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Format**: What did you do? What will you do? Any blockers?

### Sprint Planning
- **When**: Every 2 weeks
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Goal**: Plan next sprint, review previous sprint

### Retrospective
- **When**: End of each sprint
- **Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Goal**: Identify improvements and celebrate successes
